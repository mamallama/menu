#Menu Maker
### Introduction
This is a menu maker app. Users are able to create, edit, and delete dishes. Three courses are set and dishes can be assigned to either 'Appetizer', 'Entree', or 'Dessert'.
Users can edit the information entered either by selecting the 'edit' link or by clicking on the dish name.

### Flow chart

##### Things I did not accomplish:
- Users should be able to add dishes for a specific course by clicking on an add link underneath that specific course. In other words, there should be no "course" dropdown on the dish's new page. That should be determined based on which link you clicked on in the first place.
X Users should be able to destroy a dish by going to the dish's edit page and then hitting a delete button on that page.

- The application should be deployed to Heroku.
